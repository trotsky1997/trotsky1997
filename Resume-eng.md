## <img src="assets/project-diagram-solid.svg" width="30px"> Project Experience

- **USTC Campus Invitational Algorithm Competition**, Champion

    After extracting multi-angle features from tax data and desensitized registration information like Community Discovering on interpersonal graphs and statistical features, we use a time-series convolutional neural networks to identify their risky probabilities. This algorithm has been deployed in Wuhu smart city big data platform after that competition.

- **Logistics robot hotlink optimization**, Cooperation project with EFORT Intelligent Equipment Co., Ltd. 

    By planning the hotspot switching strategy for the robot's route through the factory, We can reduce the problems of robots caused by the hotspot switching, such as  network delay or dropping.

- **"Jiajia" humanoid robot**, Cooperation project with National Grid

    *Human-robot interaction, dialogue system, customer service robot, BERT*

    Participated in the design for the emotion recognition module and the collection of a datasets in human-robot conversational interaction. We applying cutting-edge models such as BERT and TF-IDF to develop the emotion recognition algorithm in the dialogue system, so that business establishments can find what affecting their user’s experience and service quality and make it better.

- **Alibaba Cloud Digital Intelligence Service Innovation Challenge 2020**, Top 4%

    Liking task scheduling on distributed platforms, to improve the task allocation efficiency of technicians in an ideal service platform, we developed a constrained search optimization algorithm to scheduling tasks and reducing the average waitting time of customer’s jobs  and average workflow stress of technicians.In addition, when priority preemption occurs, the preempt service must be transferred safely.
    
- **Giant Panda “humanoid” Robot**, Cooperation Project with Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding Basement

    Participated in the design for the front-end interaction module of the robot, allowing the robot to interact with visitors to the site more naturally and intimately, including tour guidance, proactively seek out visitors to initiate interactions, and answer displays etc.
    
- **AI-Earth 2021 El Nino-Southern Oscillation Indicator Prediction Contest**,Top 10%

    This competition gives global weather data for the past years and asks for predicting the ENSO index in the coming year. After constructing higher-order interaction features, we extract the representation vectors of the weather maps through an attention-based convolutional neural network, finally the future ENSO index is predicted by a time-series Seq2Seq approach.
