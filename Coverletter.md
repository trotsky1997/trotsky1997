# Cover Letter

Dear Professors,

My name is Di Zhang, and I am studying in the Robotics Lab at the University of Science and Technology of China, where I am pursuing my master's degree. My past research interests are machine learning and robot human-robot interaction.
I was fortunate to see your admissions article and I think my experience may match this position well. So I wrote to you to apply for this PhD position in 2022.During my time at USTC, I have been involved in robotics projects such as "Jiajia" humanoid robot, "Kejia" robot platform, and "Xiaochuan" giant panda “Humanoid” robot, which involve robot control, neural network, NLP, and computer vision.

In addition, I have participated in internships at Microsoft Research Asia and Ant Group(Alibaba), where I have involved in distributed machine learning platform development and algorithm implementation.
In terms of engineering development, I can use Pytorch, keras and other mainstream machine learning  toolboxies to build models for problems and reproduce works quickly.

Finally, I have rich experience in machine learning competitions held by Ali Cloud Platform and Kaggle and achieved good results. I have experience in open source developments , I can use Git to manage code and ML development environments. I can skillfully use crawler, Google Scholar, Zotero, LaTeX and other tools for information collection, literature searching, management and paper writing.

I can start my work at the first time after my graduation from USTC and I have already prepared Research plans for further discussion.

My CV is attached, It would be my great honor to have a opportunity to work with you!

Thanks, 

Di Zhang
